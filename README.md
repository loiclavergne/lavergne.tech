My name is **LoÃ¯c Lavergne**, and I'm a dedicated and experienced Tech Lead in the mobile industry.
 
Currently, I am working on Roole Map and am excited about the progress we are making. In my spare time, I am also developing a tiny [Plex](https://plex.tv) client for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and macOS, based on a personal modified design of the [Apple TV](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-app/) app. Additionally, I am adapting [Prince of Persia](https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II) on the [Playdate](https://play.date), which has been a fun and challenging project.

When I'm not working on technology-related projects, I enjoy reading, playing piano, and chess. I am always happy to discuss topics related to Swift, iOS, or Apple, so feel free to ask me anything.

If you would like to get in touch with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can find my contact information below. Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction.
