My name is **Lo√Øc Lavergne**, and I'm a dedicated and experienced Tech Lead in the mobile industry.
 
I'm currently working on [Roole Map](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1621923838) and I'm excited about the progress we are making. In my spare time, I'm also developing a tiny [Plex](https://plex.tv) client for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and macOS, based on a personal modified design of the [Apple TV](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-app/) app. Additionally, I am adapting [Prince of Persia](https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II) on the [Playdate](https://play.date), which has been a fun and challenging project.

When I'm not working on technology-related projects, I enjoy reading, playing piano, and chess. I'm always happy to discuss topics related to Swift, iOS, or Apple, so feel free to ask me anything.
